# Project status

Updated 2026-11-04. MJL is under development; implemented does not mean accepted
or production-ready. This file describes the current boundary, not authorization
for another feature. [Business rules](business-rules.md) define behavior;
[engineering](engineering.md), [security](security.md) and [design](design.md)
own their subjects. [README](../README.md) owns setup and development commands.

## Implemented

- Invited accounts, password/OTP sessions, ordinary lifecycle/recovery and
  permanently Partner-bound identities.
- Direct entry to login or the existing role workspace (user management for Admin,
  Partner overview for Partner users, projects for internal business roles).
  Authentication screens follow the supplied references; OTP fields support
  typing, paste, correction and automatic submission on the sixth digit. Session revalidation is automatic and masks stale
  identity while checking, without replaying writes. Admin users, history and
  account pages share the reference navigation; default list URLs omit empty
  filters and first-page parameters. Page and section loading placeholders cover
  authentication, administration, planning, execution, Partner views, history,
  notifications, service status and document previews; session retry shows loading
  while keeping protected content masked.
- Partner/Project/PTA planning, independent Activity review, amendments,
  unstarted withdrawal and forward annual transfer.
- Operation execution, exact spending, separate budget-increase funding approvals,
  décaissement/virement approvals, external settlement and Activity/Project closure.
- Validated zero-spending closure and direct correction after financial return.
- Assigned-Agent reminders, recipient notifications, optional Activity evidence,
  reasoned withdrawal, image preview and Validator-controlled Partner sharing.
- Whole-PTA metrics, internal and sanitized Partner Fiches, global audit/CSV,
  internal annual CSV/Excel/PDF working reports and Partner-scoped PTA CSV.
- Local real email accounts and five French HTML/plain-text messages via Resend.
- Installable PWA with online-only business operations and guarded update handling.

The schema head is 0024_budget_funding. Application code, migrations and focused
tests are the implementation evidence; do not treat a summary or an old passing
count as a new verification run.

## Remaining inputs and excluded work

| Subject              | Boundary / owner                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Production           | Deployment/accounts, provider/region, legal/RSSI acceptance and operations evidence remain unapproved; see security requirements.                                                                            |
| Mail                 | Live Gmail/Outlook/inbox evidence remains owner-directed after private configuration. Production scheduling, retry, queues, webhooks and browser push are outside scope.                                     |
| Documents            | Production storage/scanning/retention/key custody require data-owner/RSSI input. PDF preview, restoration, general versioning and other attachment contexts are not enabled.                                 |
| Lifecycle            | Technical Admin recovery/reinvitation, reverse transfer and general reopening/restoration remain excluded. Future Partner deactivation requires no active Project or unfinished Activity.                    |
| Reporting/accounting | Official templates, accounting rules/examples, SPD meaning and delivery acceptance need client input. Past-date reconstruction and global audit PDF/XLSX remain deferred. Partner annual export is CSV-only. |
| Financial exceptions | No banking execution, partial reversement or reallocation. A real late settlement exception needs user clarification; do not invent one.                                                                     |
| Visual acceptance    | Human visual/accessibility/client-copy acceptance remains outstanding.                                                                                                                                       |

## Known verification limitations

Prior frontend checks reported a large-bundle warning and a development-only
Stylelint/glob dependency advisory. No new dependency audit was run for this
documentation consolidation; verify the current candidate before dependency work
and avoid force-downgrading tooling to obsolete releases. No production/compliance
assessment follows from development checks.
